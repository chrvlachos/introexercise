          Santorini, officially Thira and classic Greek Thera, is an island in
          the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km (120 mi) southeast from Greece.
          Its the largest island of a small, circular archipelago, which bears
          the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera.The island was
          the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history:
          the Minoan eruption (sometimes called the Thera eruption), which
          occurred about 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan
          civilization. The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic
          ash deposits hundreds of metres deep. It may have led indirectly to
          the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete, 110 km
          (68 mi) to the south, through a gigantic tsunami. Another popular
          theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of
          Atlantis.

          Mykonos is a Greek island, part of the Cyclades, lying between Tinos,
          Syros, Paros and Naxos. Mykonos's nickname is "The Island of the
          Winds". Tourism is a major industry and Mykonos is known for its
          vibrant nightlife and for being a gay-friendly destination with many
          establishments catering for the LGBT community. In Greek mythology,
          Mykonos was named after its first ruler, Mykonos (Μύκονος), the son or
          grandson of the god Apollo and a local hero. The island is also said
          to have been the location of the Gigantomachy, the great battle
          between Zeus and Giants and where Hercules killed the invincible
          giants having lured them from the protection of Mount Olympus.
          According to myth, the large rocks all over the island are said to be
          the petrified corpses of the giants.

          Navagio Beach, or Shipwreck Beach, is an exposed cove, sometimes
          referred to as "Smugglers Cove", on the coast of Zakynthos, in the
          Ionian Islands of Greece. Navagio Beach was originally known as Agios
          Georgios. On 2 October 1980, the coaster MV Panagiotis, ran aground in
          the waters around Zakynthos Island on Navagio Beach during stormy
          weather and bad visibility. Some rumours claim the ship was smuggling
          contraband; however official sources did not confirm this, and the
          captain was not convicted for such offences. In fact, after the
          captain alerted the authorities, 29 locals were convicted of looting
          the cargo and valuable equipment from the wrecked ship. The ship was
          abandoned and still rests buried in the limestone gravel of the beach
          that now bears the nickname Shipwreck.
